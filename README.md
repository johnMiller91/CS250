# Sprint Review and Retrospective

The Sprint Review and Retrospective represent my ability to interpret user needs and develop them into a program. This is done through Scrum-agile tools such as user stories representing a feature or requirement for the project. This project required refining and prioritization of these stories to create a deliverable. 
I enjoyed the modular development approach of a Scrum-agile methodology. This is similar to how I have approached other coding projects. Building and developing a requirement til it is an acceptable level of "done" makes sense to me and is an approach I enjoy. 
A good team member on a development team is courageous. They courageously communicate issues with team members, stakeholders, or management. They also courageously ask for help or admit when they are stuck. They also practice transparency and good communication with others.
