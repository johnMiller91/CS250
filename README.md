# Sprint Review and Retrospective

The Sprint Review and Retrospective represents my ability to interpert user needs and develop them into a program. This is done through the use of Scrum-agile tools such a user stories that represent a feature or requirement for the project. This project required the refinement and priortization of these stories in order to create a deliverable. \n
